# Gradient Boosting from Scratch (C++)

This project is a simple, educational implementation of **Gradient Boosting Regressor** in C++ from scratch.

It uses **decision stumps (1-level decision trees)** as weak learners to fit a regression model by minimizing mean squared error.

## 🚀 Features
- Gradient Boosting for regression
- Decision Stump weak learners
- CSV data loader
- Simple console predictions

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/` — source files (.cpp)
- `include/` — header files (.h)
- `data/` — input CSV file
- `build/` — compiled binaries

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

Make sure you have `clang++` or `g++` installed.

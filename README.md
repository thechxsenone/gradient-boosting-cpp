# Gradient Boosting from Scratch (C++)

This project is an educational implementation of **Gradient Boosting for regression** written entirely in **C++** from scratch.

The goal is to deeply understand the inner workings of gradient boosting, decision stumps, and the boosting process by manually coding the entire pipeline â€” without using external machine learning libraries.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Gradient Boosting Regressor implementation  
âœ… Uses **decision stumps** (1-level decision trees) as weak learners  
âœ… Fits an ensemble by sequentially minimizing **mean squared error (MSE)**  
âœ… Fully written in modern C++ (C++17)  
âœ… Loads data from a CSV file  
âœ… Console-based predictions output
